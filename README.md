# GNOSIS   

GNOSIS is a learning approach that addresses the Minimum Vertex Cover problem through the combination of Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

This solution combines the representation power of a Graph Neural Network approach with the ability of actor-critic Reinforcement Learning to provide strong solutions.

The code requires installing DGL ([Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/)).   

  ## Network Î¤opologies & Metrics
  
  **Network topologies**:

 - Erdo-Renyi
 - Watts-Strogatz
 - Barabasi-Albert

**Evaluation metrics**:

- **Execution time**: refers to the total amount of time each algorithm requires to produce a solution
-  **Cost function**: This function calculates a cost based on the number of image replicas placed on the network as well as the transfer delays, in order to share the image between all network nodes
- **Vertex cover set size**: the size of vertices in vertex cover

## Configuration File

In `parameters_config.json` file, several variables can be configured:

    "episode": 5
    "network": "barabasi_albert",  
    "number_of_nodes": 64,  
    "probability": 0.5,  
    "degree": 1,  
    "knearest": 2  

`episode`: Episode is a sequence of interactions between an agent and the environment 

`network`: The name of the network (*choose between erdos_renyi, barabasi_albert or newman_watts_strogatz*)

`number_of_nodes`: The number of nodes of the graph

`probability`: The probability of adding a new edge for each edge (*only for Erdo-Renyi and Watts-Strogatz graphs*)

`degree`: Number of edges to attach from a new node to existing nodes (*only for Barabasi-Albert graphs*)

`knearest`: Each node is joined with its $k$ nearest neighbors in a ring topology (*only for Watts-Strogatz graphs*)
